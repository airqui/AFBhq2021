# raw studies for s-quark analysis

Main code is in QQbarAnalysisClass.C
  --> virtual void AFBreconstruction(int , TString, int, float, float, int);
  function that reconstructs the AFB angular distribution for different quarks in the initial state
  and for different preselection steps.
  It provides histograms to calculate the total selection efficiency and the migrations.
  Different levels of cheatiness and "reconness".
  Also different levels of K-Id (loose or tight)


  --> virtual void KaonEfficiency(int , TString, float, float, int);
  function that creats histograms to measure the kaon ID performance (purity and efficiency)
  It includes also some histograms using mc_stable but these variables are not correctly filled by the processor.

Running:

assuming ht-condor batch system and assuming that you have all your ntuples in one folder 
--> source launch.sh
        --> that runs analysis.sh (need to change the folder parameter)
            --> that runs the analysis.cc

when it finish: 
    --> source hadd.sh --> to merge all files together.



Analysis of the results
cd macros
#AFB stuff
root -l -q Efficiency.C --> to create selection efficiency plots
root -l -q Migrations.C --> to create AFB plots with only signal (with cheated and reco sign of the charge)
root -l -q Contamination.C --> to create AFB plots at reco level including backgrounds. Cheating or not in the determination of the charge.

#Kaon ID stuff
root -l -q Efficiency_Kaon.C --> to create 2D plots of purity and efficiency of Kaon ID using the TPC info.
